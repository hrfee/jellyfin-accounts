**Describe the bug**

Describe the problem, and what you would expect if it isn't clear already.

**To Reproduce**

What to do to reproduce the problem.

**Logs**

When you notice the problem, check the output of `jf-accounts`.  If the problem is not obvious (e.g an expection or 'ERROR' log), try enabling `debug` in your configuration's `[ui]` section, restarting and reproducing the problem. You should then take a screenshot of the output, or paste it here, preferably between \`\`\` tags (e.g \`\`\``Log here`\`\`\`).
If nothing catches your eye in the log, access the admin page via your browser, go into the console (Right click > Inspect Element > Console), refresh, then paste the output here in the same way as above.

**Platform**

Include the platform jf-accounts is running on (e.g Windows, Linux, Docker), the python version, and if necessary the browser version and platform.
